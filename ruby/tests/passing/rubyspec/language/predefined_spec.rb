Exception Information 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$!               Exception       The exception object passed to raise. [thread] 
$@               Array           The stack backtrace generated by the last exception. [thread]

Pattern Matching Variables 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These variables (except $=) are set to nil after an unsuccessful pattern match.

$&               String          The string matched (following a successful pattern match). This variable is 
                                 local to the current scope. [r/o, thread] 
$+               String          The contents of the highest-numbered group matched following a successful 
                                 pattern match. Thus, in "cat" =~/(c|a)(t|z)/, $+ will be set to “t”. This 
                                 variable is local to the current scope. [r/o, thread] 
$`               String          The string preceding the match in a successful pattern match. This variable 
                                 is local to the current scope. [r/o, thread] 
$'               String          The string following the match in a successful pattern match. This variable 
                                 is local to the current scope. [r/o, thread] 
$=               Object          Deprecated.1.8 If set to any value apart from nil or false, all pattern matches 
                                 will be case insensitive, string comparisons will ignore case, and string hash 
                                 values will be case insensitive. 
$1 to $9         String          The contents of successive groups matched in a successful pattern match. In 
                                 "cat" =~/(c|a)(t|z)/, $1 will be set to “a” and $2 to “t”. This variable 
                                 is local to the current scope. [r/o, thread] 
$~               MatchData       An object that encapsulates the results of a successful pattern match. The 
                                 variables $&, $`, $', and $1 to $9 are all derived from $~. Assigning to $~ 
                                 changes the values of these derived variables. This variable is local to the 
                                 current scope. [thread]

Input/Output Variables 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$/               String          The input record separator (newline by default). This is the value that rou- 
                                 tines such as Kernel#gets use to determine record boundaries. If set to 
                                 nil, gets will read the entire file. 
$-0              String          Synonym for $/. 
$\               String          The string appended to the output of every call to methods such as 
                                 Kernel#print and IO#write. The default value is nil. 
$,               String          The separator string output between the parameters to methods such as 
                                 Kernel#print and Array#join. Defaults to nil, which adds no text. 
$.               Fixnum          The number of the last line read from the current input file. 
$;               String          The default separator pattern used by String#split. May be set from the 
                                 command line using the -F flag.
$<               Object          An object that provides access to the concatenation of the contents of all 
                                 the files given as command-line arguments or $stdin (in the case where 
                                 there are no arguments). $< supports methods similar to a File object: 
                                 binmode, close, closed?, each, each_byte, each_line, eof, eof?, 
                                 file, filename, fileno, getc, gets, lineno, lineno=, path, pos, pos=, 
                                 read, readchar, readline, readlines, rewind, seek, skip, tell, to_a, 
                                 to_i, to_io, to_s, along with the methods in Enumerable. The method 
                                 file returns a File object for the file currently being read. This may change 
                                 as $< reads through the files on the command line. [r/o] 
$>               IO              The destination of output for Kernel#print and Kernel#printf. The 
                                 default value is $stdout. 
$_               String          The last line read by Kernel#gets or Kernel#readline. Many string- 
                                 related functions in the Kernel module operate on $_ by default. The vari- 
                                 able is local to the current scope. [thread] 
$-F              String          Synonym for $;. 
$stderr          IO              The current standard error output. 
$stdin           IO              The current standard input. 
$stdout          IO              The current standard output. Assignment to $stdout is deprecated: use 
                                 $stdout.reopen instead.

Execution Environment Variables 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$0               String          The name of the top-level Ruby program being executed. Typically this will 
                                 be the program’s filename. On some operating systems, assigning to this 
                                 variable will change the name of the process reported (for example) by the 
                                 ps(1) command. 
$*               Array           An array of strings containing the command-line options from the invoca- 
                                 tion of the program. Options used by the Ruby interpreter will have been 
                                 removed. [r/o] 
$"               Array           An array containing the filenames of modules loaded by require. [r/o] 
$$               Fixnum          The process number of the program being executed. [r/o] 
$?               Process::Status The exit status of the last child process to terminate. [r/o, thread] 
$:               Array           An array of strings, where each string specifies a directory to be searched for 
                                 Ruby scripts and binary extensions used by the load and require methods. 
                                 The initial value is the value of the arguments passed via the -I command- 
                                 line option, followed by an installation-defined standard library location, fol- 
                                 lowed by the current directory (“.”). This variable may be set from within a 
                                 program to alter the default search path; typically, programs use $: << dir 
                                 to append dir to the path. [r/o] 
$-a              Object          True if the -a option is specified on the command line. [r/o]
$-d              Object          Synonym for $DEBUG. 
$DEBUG           Object          Set to true if the -d command-line option is specified. 
__FILE__         String          The name of the current source file. [r/o] 
$F               Array           The array that receives the split input line if the -a command-line option is 
                                 used. 
$FILENAME        String          The name of the current input file. Equivalent to $<.filename. [r/o] 
$-i              String          If in-place edit mode is enabled (perhaps using the -i command-line 
                                 option), $-i holds the extension used when creating the backup file. If you 
                                 set a value into $-i, enables in-place edit mode.
$-I              Array           Synonym for $:. [r/o] 
$-K              String          Sets the multibyte coding system for strings and regular expressions. Equiv- 
                                 alent to the -K command-line option.
$-l              Object          Set to true if the -l option (which enables line-end processing) is present 
                                 on the command line. [r/o] 
__LINE__         String          The current line number in the source file. [r/o] 
$LOAD_PATH       Array           A synonym for $:. [r/o] 
$-p              Object          Set to true if the -p option (which puts an implicit while gets . . . end 
                                 loop around your program) is present on the command line. [r/o] 
$SAFE            Fixnum          The current safe level. This variable’s value may never be 
                                 reduced by assignment. [thread] 
$VERBOSE         Object          Set to true if the -v, --version, -W, or -w option is specified on the com- 
                                 mand line. Set to false if no option, or -W1 is given. Set to nil if -W0 
                                 was specified. Setting this option to true causes the interpreter and some 
                                 library routines to report additional information. Setting to nil suppresses 
                                 all warnings (including the output of Kernel.warn). 
$-v              Object          Synonym for $VERBOSE. 
$-w              Object          Synonym for $VERBOSE.

Global Constants 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following constants are defined by the Ruby interpreter. 

DATA                 IO          If the main program file contains the directive __END__, then 
                                 the constant DATA will be initialized so that reading from it will 
                                 return lines following __END__ from the source file. 
FALSE                FalseClass  Synonym for false. 
NIL                  NilClass    Synonym for nil. 
RUBY_PLATFORM        String      The identifier of the platform running this program. This string 
                                 is in the same form as the platform identifier used by the GNU 
                                 configure utility (which is not a coincidence). 
PLATFORM             String      Same as RUBY_PLATFORM.
RUBY_RELEASE_DATE    String      The date of this release. 
RUBY_VERSION         String      The version number of the interpreter. 
STDERR               IO          The actual standard error stream for the program. The initial 
                                 value of $stderr. 
STDIN                IO          The actual standard input stream for the program. The initial 
                                 value of $stdin. 
STDOUT               IO          The actual standard output stream for the program. The initial 
                                 value of $stdout. 
SCRIPT_LINES__       Hash        If a constant SCRIPT_LINES__ is defined and references a Hash, 
                                 Ruby will store an entry containing the contents of each file it 
                                 parses, with the file’s name as the key and an array of strings as 
                                 the value.
TOPLEVEL_BINDING     Binding     A Binding object representing the binding at Ruby’s top level— 
                                 the level where programs are initially executed. 
TRUE                 TrueClass   Synonym for true.
